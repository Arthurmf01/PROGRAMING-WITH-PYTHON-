Exercises
In this exercise we will create an HTTP server to which we can upload a
 graph and in which we can get the degrees of separation between two nodes in the graph.
1. Create a route in the server to which the user can upload a graph using 
JSON and using the POST http method. The JSON data should be passed as part of the request body,
 not in the URL.
2. Create a route to get the degrees of separation between two nodes in the previously uploaded graph.
localhost:5000/degrees_of_separation/<origin>/<destination>.
You can use any code we want from the exercises weâ€™ve done in class
related to graphs.

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

server = Flask("Server Running on port 5000")   

@server.route('/upload-graph', methods=['POST'])
def upload_graph():
    body = request.get_json()
    return jsonify(body)

@server.route('/degrees-of-separation/<start>/<end>', methods=['POST'])

def degrees_of_separation(start,end,path=[],graph=""):
   
    graph_example = request.get_json()  
    path = path + [start]
    
    if start == end:
        degree_of_separation = len(path) - 2
        return jsonify(degree_of_separation)
                       
    if start not in graph_example:
        return jsonify("The node requested is not in Graph")
    
    for node in graph_example[start]:
        if node not in path:
            newpath = degrees_of_separation(node, end, path, graph_example)
            if newpath is not None:
                return newpath
            
    return jsonify("None")

                
server.run()
