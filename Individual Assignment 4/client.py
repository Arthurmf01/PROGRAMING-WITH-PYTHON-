Exercises
In this exercise we will create an HTTP server to which we can upload a
 graph and in which we can get the degrees of separation between two nodes in the graph.
1. Create a route in the server to which the user can upload a graph using 
JSON and using the POST http method. The JSON data should be passed as part of the request body,
 not in the URL.
2. Create a route to get the degrees of separation between two nodes in the previously uploaded graph.
localhost:5000/degrees_of_separation/<origin>/<destination>.
You can use any code we want from the exercises weâ€™ve done in class
related to graphs.

    return resquest.json()
